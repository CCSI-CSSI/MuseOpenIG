Muse OpenIG can be built using QTCreator and its QMake utility
or the CMake system.  We have provided the necessary configuration
files for either build system.  Under Microsoft Windows the
config files are expecting that you will be using one of
the MSVC releases, currently tested with Visual Studio 2013.
Under Linux it will be expected that you have installed at
least QT5.x or GCC 4.8.3

For MacOSX we have tested this on Xcode 6.x and 7 releases,
using the Clang build system for both QT5.x and CMake.
Alsl for MacOSX, due to limitations in OpenSceneGraph
the ForwardPlusLighting plugin does not work, at least
as of OSG 3.4.0 and 3.5.3 developer release.

Here is a list of the Environmental variables that are
needed on the system before you can successfully build
Muse OpenIG from source.  Qmake and Cmake use these environmental
variables for locating the dependency files and install
locations for OpenIG and its plug-ins.

If you still have problems compiling or installing,
consult the CMakeFiles.txt or the projects *.pro file directly
for more variables and/or information that you might need
to properly configure your system to build OpenIG properly.

If all else fails you can locate or request more help on the OpenIG forum:

All Platforms
-----------------
For Sundogs SilverLining:
SILVERLINING_PATH = Location of SilverLining Resources directory

For Sundogs Triton:
TRITON_PATH = Location of Triton Resources directory

For the Boost Libraries, some/all these env variables
have been used/needed in the past:
BOOST_DIRS = Location of Boost
BOOST_ROOT = Location of the stage\lib directories after building boost
BOOST_INCLUDE_DIRS = Location of Boost
BOOST_INCLUDEDIR = Location of Boost
BOOST_LIBRARYDIR = Location of Boost's compiled libraries

For OpenSceneGraph
OSGDIR = Location of the directory containing OSG Include and Library directories
OSG_FILE_PATH = Location(s) of any directories containing textures for use in OpenSceneGraph/OpenIG

For OSGBullet:
OSGBULLET_ROOT = Location of where OSG Bullet is installed



Windows Platform Specific
----------------
OpenIG install location:
OPENIG_BUILD=Location/directory where to install OpenIG with the Make Install
             or the Install solution under MSVC

Triton:
TRITON=Directory containing "Triton", the include files

SilverLining:
SILVERLINING=Directory containing "Public Headers", the include files

For location of OpenSceneGraph for all the other libs and plug-ins to find OSG
You need one or the other of these to be set in your Environment:
OSG_ROOT = Location of the directory containing OSG Include and Library directorie
OSG_BUILD = Location of where OSG was built

For OSGEarth:
OSGEARTH_ROOT=Location of OsgEarth libraries and include files
