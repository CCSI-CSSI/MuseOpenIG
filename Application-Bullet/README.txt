To run this demo standalone, please set your environmental variable
OPENIG_NETWORKING_MODE=NONE.  Then simply start the demo application
as normal.  Use the up/down arrow keys to go forward and reverse, 
left/right arrow keys to steer.

Otherwise you will need to run 2 copies of the demo, one as master
the other as the slave after setting up the proper network settings
for your local network in the network plugins xml data/config file
settings.  This file and all the OIG plugin files should be located
in the plugins directory with all the plugin shared library files.
