6 Jul 2015, version 1.1.0
- Added support for FBX animations through the new IgPlugin-FBXAnimation plugin
- Added support for OSG ParticleEffects (smoke, explosions, fire ..) through the IgPlugin-OSGParticleEffects plugin
- Added support for osgEarth and osgEarth's SimpleLighting through the IgPlugin-OSGEarthSimpleLighting plugin, as well as shader 
  composition and a sample demo application, openig-earth.
- Added support for Bullet vehicle physics through the IgPlugin-Bullet as well as a sample openig-bullet demo application
- Moved the clouds related commands into the IgPlugin-SilverLining plugin and out of the OpenIG main application.
  Same for the SkyDome plugin, all plugin related commands now reside in their respective plugins.
- Temporary workaround for TOD 0 and model lighting. This will be revisited in a future release for a more permanent fix.
- Reorganized the OpenIG file structure.  All demo apps now reside in their own directories, each with its own set of
  configuration and support files.  This keeps things a bit more structured and easy to find for configuration changes.
- Added a new light attibute for adjustment of the brighness on SilverLining clouds, together with matching changes to the
  SilverLining userfunctions shaders/files.
- Added support for light brightness adjustment based on TOD as read from an XML configuration file.
- Revisited CMake configuration files for the newly reorganized file structure of OpenIG, as well as a few minor bug fixes.
